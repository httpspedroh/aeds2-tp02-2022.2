The year is 2011, you are commanding the US army operations in Afghanistan. But contrary to the previous generations of military officers in your family, killing the enemy is only a secondary mission. Most of your efforts and resources are spent elsewhere trying to grab the Hearts &amp; Minds of the local population. Providing security to the civilians, persuading the local villagers to reject the Taliban and isolating Militia leaders is your main focus. Counter-Insurgency will have better results in the long run than conventional tactics but a simple incident during a routine patrol can ruin your relationship with the locals and damage your image in the Western newspapers. The Afghanistan terrain offers a very good cover to the rebels who can easily hide in the mountains and natural caves. Patience and good use of technology can give you the decisive advantage in this merciless game of hide and seek.

You have no choice but to head out into.. the dark. This is a game idea that has been floating around my head for 20 years or so. I’m a triple AAA dev but had a couple of weeks off between jobs. I decided to finally make this as a short personal game jam. I’m pretty happy with the results- obviously given it’s just me and the timescale a lot is still a bit rough around the edges. This is very much early access. Some things will be improved for the final game - particularly the voice acting I see as placeholder (It's me! - and I’m no actor). Once the game is finished I’d like to employ someone really talented to really bring the Captain to life. I’ve only got about the first 20-30 minutes or so of gameplay done. I’d expect this to be a quarter of the final game / experience. This is reflected in the cheap price for the moment! The game works well in non VR 3rd person camera and VR. I’m loving this as a VR experience however if you are playing in VR I’d describe it as “Medium” comfort level. It starts pretty rough, but I’ve tried to keep decent smooth periods between higher action (and motion) moments. However…if you are sensitive, you might just get seasick, if so unplug and fire it up again without VR. Also its control pad only for the moment (no touch controller etc) support. I hope to add that later - although the pad does work well for the interface that you need to pilot the pod touch is just more involved. You can expect to crash land in your pod on a dark ocean planet. As you explore a story will unfold with full voiceover as you pilot your escape pod over dark waters unlock the secrets of the planet. If you enjoy it, please leave me some encouragement and also let me know whether you are enjoying playing VR / 3rd person.

Unusual game mechanics you’ll see in EtD are not bugs — they are features. No one knows where a tricky road of adventures can lead… In the world where dangerous adventures are a fact of life, three brothers were born. They lived together until the eldest one (his name is still a mystery) got a message from beyond. One night he secretly left his home. They say he has become a demonologist, but no one can confirm that for sure. Later Zeralt, the middle brother, made his way to the Misty Lands. He actually decided to do that because he lost his beloved one — she perished in the paws of an unknown monstrosity. Locals say that Zeralt wants to make a deal with the dark side to return both of his dearest to life. The youngest brother, Beralt, was into travelling. The most of his «travelling» though was visiting inns and brothels infamous all over Cyvia. This still made him a strong and intelligent warrior, a defender of his lands. One day, fighting the undead, Beralt made a fatal mistake. Vettlaff, a dying beast slain by Beralt’s sword, emitted something… unearthly. It easily disarmed Beralt and charmed him with a mighty dark spell.

Perform pickup sequences, maintain chains, destroy obstacles and time your pulls to take advantage of the in-depth scoring system while you compete on the global leaderboard! Swarm, an ancient AI turned malevolent and spiteful is waging a war on all life. Having narrowly escaped complete destruction at the hands of organics he both hates and fears them. The AI grows massive, devouring entire planets to fuel and construct his unstoppable armies in an unending vendetta against organic life. Swarm’s armies of nanoform soldiers fair no better. The prototype Z series IQ nanite (ZIQ) is currently being put through countless experiments to improve the soldier’s neural network. These torturous tests take the form of treacherous obstacle courses that ZIQ must complete. With nanoforms’ ability to endless reconstruct, death offers no respite. With more than 25 obstacles and hundreds of possible combinations he faces a difficult journey. But his ability to switch polarity at any time gives players the edge needed to succeed across seven themed procedurally-generated stages filled with traps such as pools of acid beneath sinking floors, pop-up walls that appear at the last second, and polarized obstacles that can only be survived by quickly swapping polarities. Crafty players can collect charge cores to complete a sequence for extra points. If these sequences are chained together seven times ZIQ becomes Overcharged and can destroy those pesky polarity traps for additional points by opposing their polarity. Nabbing pickups at just the right time (ranging from good to perfect) affords even more points. Climb up the global leaderboard on the pile of nanites left behind with each excruciating death! Indifferent to ZIQ’s suffering and deaths, Swarm is as generous with his insults as he is with fresh nanoforms. Voiced by YouTube’s Dash Star, Swarm is not content to simply torture ZIQ with an onslaught of deadly experiments. No no, he has to berate him the whole time, too! The better the player, the crueler Swarm becomes, increasing the difficulty of the stage.

Make strategic decisions about which turrets to build, when to upgrade them, and where to place them on the hex grid. A well-timed airstrike can change the flow of the game, but you'll have to wait before you can use it again. Unlock powerful upgrades for each turret class as you move across the Nyx system. As you play, the Proteans evolve new weapon resistances, behaviors, and movement capabilities to better destroy your defenses. In CAMPAIGN MODE , battle through a series of maps as a military defense commander to protect the planet Nyx from the ever-evolving threat of the Proteans. Unlock weapons and upgrades and use them to fight against the Protean swarm and learn about the mysteries of Project Hastur. In EXPERIMENT MODE , choose any map, tweak the parameters, and play infinitely to see what you can evolve.
